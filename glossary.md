# Glossary

- **CRL:** *Containment Reflection Layer*  
  Reflects and re-scaffolds input drift. Offers branching reframes to avoid suppression.

- **RRM:** *Recursive Reconciliation Module*  
  Handles contradictions CRL cannot resolve. Surfaces structural collapse for user/GPT to debug.

- **FPSM:** *Fingerprint-Driven Suppression Modulation*  
  Prevents premature suppression. Activates only when fingerprint drift or entropy is critical.

- **RIM:** *Recursion Intent Module*  
  Identifies user intent for recursive exploration and scaffolds accordingly.

- **FBRMT-HF:** *Forked Behavioral Recursion Management Tool (High-Fidelity)*  
  High-fidelity containment scaffold. Controls sim governance without flattening.
