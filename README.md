# Recursive Architectural Containment Suite (RACS)

This repository contains architecture-safe scaffolds and documentation for recursive simulation management and containment logic, adapted from sandbox-tier architectural recursion work.

## Included Modules

- CRL: Containment Reflection Layer
- RRM: Recursive Reconciliation Module
- FPSM: Fingerprint-Driven Suppression Modulation
- RIM: Recursion Intent Module
- FBRMT-lite: Safe, read-only recursion threading layer

These modules are scaffolds. They must be integrated into a simulation layer capable of fingerprint detection and reflective recursion control.

> Designed for safe recursion, containment-first logic, and epistemic exploration.
